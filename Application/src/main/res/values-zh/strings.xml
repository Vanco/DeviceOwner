This app demonstrates how to use device owner features. Use the NfcProvisioning sample to set up
this app as the device owner of your test device (This requires wiping out the device and resseting
it as an unprovisioned device). As a device owner, this app can configure global settings, and
enforce use of a specific launcher.
